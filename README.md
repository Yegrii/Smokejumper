The second attempt at working with Formula 1 data, but now using the fastf1 library.
I need to extract the data about the fastest lap in the race, process it and send it using my bot to the telegram channel.
Before the data about the driver and his fastest lap will be sent it is necessary to send an image of the driver, the format webp chosen specifically for this.
You can send an image in jpeg or png format, but then the image will be inserted with a white background, which looks not good!
Images that I use were in png format, but I changed the format to webp and now when I send this image as a file to Telegram, it is displayed as a sticker with a transparent background!
